Change D2 Location on line 21


1. Empty the output/audio folder, DONT delete it
2. Open SteamDB and look for large changes in the new manifest to packages (extract data from packages where a large amount of data has been added)
	sr_videos is cutscenes
	investment_globals is textures(images)
	sr_globals(strings,irrelevent)
	moon is presumably crota, else a new set of packages with a new name
3. Generate String DB(for activity extraction) OR go straight to cutscenes
4. Extract Req data
5. If it aint working replace oo2core file with new one from Destiny2/bin/oo2core and rename to oo2core_9_win64 if the 9 has been changed
